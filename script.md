  * Conclusion
  	* System is a black box
  	* Mocking will kill you
  	* We decide on the interface (our data), but this is prone to change

* Generative testing
  * No/less literals in your test  
  * Run tests a lot of times

* Mutation Testing
  * Show flag coverage
  * Show diff, start tests

* Conclude
  * Unit testing as is, is not sufficient > Reason about your data.
  * Coverage is not all, we want to verify unwanted change.
